# Introduction to Vidurai

Welcome to **Vidurai** - the first open-source persistent memory system for AI agents.

## 🕉️ What is Vidurai?

Vidurai transforms stateless AI assistants into beings with true continuity, context, and wisdom. It provides a production-ready memory layer that allows AI agents to remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain context across sessions.

**The name Vidurai** comes from **Vidura**, the wise counselor in the Mahabharata, renowned for his memory, judgment, and guidance.

## The Problem

Modern AI assistants suffer from amnesia. Every conversation is a fresh start:

- ❌ No memory of past interactions
- ❌ No understanding of user preferences
- ❌ No ability to build relationships over time
- ❌ Repetitive and frustrating user experiences

## The Solution

Vidurai provides:

- ✅ **Persistent Memory**: Conversations and context survive across sessions
- ✅ **Intelligent Retrieval**: Relevant memories surface automatically
- ✅ **Privacy First**: Full control over what's remembered and shared
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Built for scale, security, and reliability

## Philosophy

> **"विस्मृति भी विद्या है"** (Forgetting too is knowledge)

While everyone races to give AI perfect memory, we asked a different question: **What if forgetting is the key to true intelligence?**

Vidurai implements strategic forgetting through:

- **Three-Kosha Architecture**: Inspired by Vedantic consciousness layers
- **Vismriti Engine**: The art of strategic forgetting (90% fewer tokens, 70% lower costs)
- **Viveka Layer**: Autonomous conscience that decides what matters

## Quick Start
